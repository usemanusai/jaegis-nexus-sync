\## \*\*NexusSync: The Unified Intelligence Engine\*\*

\### \*\*Comprehensive Task Breakdown Document\*\*



\#### \*\*Executive Summary\*\*



This document decomposes the NexusSync project into a series of epics, user stories, and granular development tasks based on the approved PRD and System Architecture. The breakdown is designed to facilitate a logical, sequential development flow, with tasks sized appropriately for execution by AI developer agents (estimated 2-4 hours each). The critical path involves establishing the core RAG service first, followed by the development of the data-providing sync services and user-facing applications.



\* \*\*Total Epics:\*\* 6

\* \*\*Total User Stories:\*\* 24

\* \*\*AI Agents Required:\*\* Frontend Developer (React/TS), Backend Developer (Node.js/NestJS), Backend Developer (Python/FastAPI), Backend Developer (Rust), DevOps/Platform Engineer.

\### \*\*Epic 1: Foundation \& Core RAG Service\*\*



\*\*Objective:\*\* Establish the project's monorepo structure, database, caching layer, and the core RAG service API for data ingestion and querying.



\* \*\*Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding \& Setup\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a developer, I want to set up the Turborepo monorepo with apps and packages directories, so that all project code is centrally managed.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Initialize Turborepo project using `npx create-turbo@latest`. [x]

&nbsp;       2.  Create initial directory structure: `apps/chrome-extension`, `apps/web-ui`, `apps/cli`, and `packages/rag-service`, `packages/github-sync`, etc. [x]

&nbsp;       3.  Configure shared ESLint and TypeScript configurations in `packages/eslint-config-custom` and `packages/tsconfig-custom`. [x]

&nbsp;       4.  Set up the GitHub repository and a basic GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) for linting and testing on push. [x]

\* \*\*Story 1.2: Data Persistence \& Caching Setup\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a developer, I want to configure PostgreSQL with Prisma and Redis 8.2 with the RGV module, so the RAG service has a persistent store and a high-performance graph-vector store.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Create a `db-schema` package and define the initial Prisma schema for documents (id, source, content, metadata, relationships). [x]

&nbsp;       2.  Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run local PostgreSQL and Redis (with RGV) containers. [x]

&nbsp;       3.  Create two environment file examples: `.env.local` (pointing to local Docker Postgres) and `.env.hybrid` (with a placeholder for a Neon URL).

&nbsp;       4.  Add instructions to the root `README.md` explaining the two deployment modes.

\* \*\*Story 1.3: Core RAG Service API\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a developer, I want to create the basic RAG service using NestJS, so that there is a central API for data ingestion.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Scaffold a new NestJS application in `packages/rag-service`.

&nbsp;       2.  Create the `ingest` module, controller, and service.

&nbsp;       3.  Implement the `POST /api/v1/ingest` endpoint that accepts data and stores its metadata in PostgreSQL via Prisma.

&nbsp;       4.  Implement a background job queue (using Redis) to handle the vectorization and graph indexing from the ingest endpoint.

\* \*\*Story 1.4: Universal AI Provider Service\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a developer, I want a universal client library compliant with the UAIGP standard, so the RAG service can leverage different models for embedding.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Create a new TS library in `packages/universal-ai`.

&nbsp;       2.  Implement a core client that is fully compliant with the Unified AI Gateway Protocol (UAIGP) standard.

&nbsp;       3.  Configure the client with connection details for OpenRouter as the initial gateway.

&nbsp;       4.  Integrate this service into the `rag-service`'s background job to generate embeddings for ingested content.

\* \*\*Story 1.5: RAG Query Endpoint\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a developer, I want to implement the query endpoint in the RAG service, so that users can retrieve information using graph-vector search.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Create the `query` module, controller, and service in `rag-service`.

&nbsp;       2.  Implement the `POST /api/v1/query` endpoint.

&nbsp;       3.  The service must take a user query, generate an embedding using the `universal-ai` service, and perform a combined graph and vector search using the RedisGraphVector module.

&nbsp;       4.  Retrieve relevant documents from PostgreSQL and return them.

\### \*\*Epic 2: Deep Research Engine \& Web UI\*\*



\*\*Objective:\*\* Build the backend service for scraping and aggregating web content, and the frontend web UI for users to manage and view research.



\* \*\*Story 2.1: Research Backend Scaffolding\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a developer, I want a Python FastAPI backend for the deep research service, so I can efficiently handle web scraping tasks.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Create a new FastAPI application in `packages/research-backend`.

&nbsp;       2.  Implement the `POST /api/v1/research` and `GET /api/v1/research/{job\_id}` endpoints.

&nbsp;       3.  Integrate Celery with the Redis instance for handling long-running scraping jobs.

\* \*\*Story 2.2: Web Scraping Logic\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a researcher, I want the backend to scrape content from a given URL, so that I can gather data.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Implement a Celery worker that uses Playwright to fetch and parse web content.

&nbsp;       2.  The worker should extract the main text content, clean it, and prepare it for ingestion.

&nbsp;       3.  The worker will call the `rag-service`'s `/api/v1/ingest` endpoint to feed the scraped content into the RAG.

\* \*\*Story 2.3: Web UI Scaffolding\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a researcher, I want a React-based web UI to interact with the research service.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Create a new React/Vite/TS application in `apps/web-ui`.

&nbsp;       2.  Configure Tailwind CSS v4.1.5 for styling.

&nbsp;       3.  Create the main application layout with a header, sidebar, and content area.

\* \*\*Story 2.4: Web UI Research Interaction\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a researcher, I want to submit a research query and view the results in the web UI.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Build a form component to submit a research query to the `research-backend`.

&nbsp;       2.  Create a "Job Status" component that polls the `GET /api/v1/research/{job\_id}` endpoint.

&nbsp;       3.  Create a results display component to render the aggregated research findings.

\### \*\*Epic 3: Chat Sync Chrome Extension\*\*



\*\*Objective:\*\* Develop the browser extension for syncing conversations from Google Gemini and chat.z.ai.



\* \*\*Story 3.1: Extension Scaffolding\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a developer, I want to scaffold the Chrome extension with the necessary manifest and build configurations.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Create a new React/Vite/TS application in `apps/chrome-extension`.

&nbsp;       2.  Create the `manifest.json` file, defining permissions, content scripts, and background logic.

&nbsp;       3.  Configure the Vite build process to output a valid extension package.

\* \*\*Story 3.2: Content Script Implementation\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a user, I want the extension to detect and extract my conversations when I'm on Gemini or chat.z.ai.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Write a content script that safely injects into the chat platforms' pages.

&nbsp;       2.  Implement DOM observers to detect new messages in the chat UI.

&nbsp;       3.  Extract message content and send it to the background sync logic.

\* \*\*Story 3.3: Real-time Sync Logic\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a developer, I want the extension to sync new messages to my RAG service in real-time.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Implement the background logic using the \*\*Service Weaves API\*\*.

&nbsp;       2.  The Service Weave will receive messages from the content script.

&nbsp;       3.  It will then call the `rag-service`'s `/api/v1/ingest` endpoint to sync the message.

\* \*\*Story 3.4: Bulk Export UI \& Logic\*\*

&nbsp;   \* As a user, I want a simple UI to trigger a bulk export of my entire chat history.

&nbsp;   \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&nbsp;       1.  Create a simple popup UI using React for the extension icon.

&nbsp;       2.  Add a "Bulk Export" button to the popup.

&nbsp;       3.  Implement the logic to programmatically scroll through the chat history, extract all messages, and send them to the RAG service.
