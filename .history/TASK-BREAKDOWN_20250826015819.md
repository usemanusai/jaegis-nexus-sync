\## \*\*NexusSync: The Unified Intelligence Engine\*\*

\### \*\*Comprehensive Task Breakdown Document\*\*

\#### \*\*Executive Summary\*\*

This document decomposes the NexusSync project into a series of epics, user stories, and granular development tasks based on the approved PRD and System Architecture. The breakdown is designed to facilitate a logical, sequential development flow, with tasks sized appropriately for execution by AI developer agents (estimated 2-4 hours each). The critical path involves establishing the core RAG service first, followed by the development of the data-providing sync services and user-facing applications.

\* \*\*Total Epics:\*\* 6

\* \*\*Total User Stories:\*\* 24

\* \*\*AI Agents Required:\*\* Frontend Developer (React/TS), Backend Developer (Node.js/NestJS), Backend Developer (Python/FastAPI), Backend Developer (Rust), DevOps/Platform Engineer.

***

\### \*\*Epic 1: Foundation & Core RAG Service\*\*

\*\*Objective:\*\* Establish the project's monorepo structure, database, caching layer, and the core RAG service API for data ingestion and querying.

\* \*\*Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Setup\*\*

&#x20; \* As a developer, I want to set up the Turborepo monorepo with apps and packages directories, so that all project code is centrally managed.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Initialize Turborepo project using `npx create-turbo@latest`. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Create initial directory structure: `apps/chrome-extension`, `apps/web-ui`, `apps/cli`, and `packages/rag-service`, `packages/github-sync`, etc. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Configure shared ESLint and TypeScript configurations in `packages/eslint-config-custom` and `packages/tsconfig-custom`. \[x]

&#x20; 4\. Set up the GitHub repository and a basic GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) for linting and testing on push. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 1.2: Data Persistence & Caching Setup\*\*

&#x20; \* As a developer, I want to configure PostgreSQL with Prisma and Redis 8.2 with the RGV module, so the RAG service has a persistent store and a high-performance graph-vector store.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Create a `db-schema` package and define the initial Prisma schema for documents (id, source, content, metadata, relationships). \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run local PostgreSQL and Redis (with RGV) containers. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Create two environment file examples: `.env.local` (pointing to local Docker Postgres) and `.env.hybrid` (with a placeholder for a Neon URL). \[x]

&#x20; 4\. Add instructions to the root `README.md` explaining the two deployment modes. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 1.3: Core RAG Service API\*\*

&#x20; \* As a developer, I want to create the basic RAG service using NestJS, so that there is a central API for data ingestion.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Scaffold a new NestJS application in `packages/rag-service`. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Create the `ingest` module, controller, and service. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Implement the `POST /api/v1/ingest` endpoint that accepts data and stores its metadata in PostgreSQL via Prisma. \[x]

&#x20; 4\. Implement a background job queue (using Redis) to handle the vectorization and graph indexing from the ingest endpoint. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 1.4: Universal AI Provider Service\*\*

&#x20; \* As a developer, I want a universal client library compliant with the UAIGP standard, so the RAG service can leverage different models for embedding.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Create a new TS library in `packages/universal-ai`. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Implement a core client that is fully compliant with the Unified AI Gateway Protocol (UAIGP) standard. \[\~] Replaced with provider abstraction targeting OpenRouter-compatible embeddings with local fallback.

&#x20; 3\. Configure the client with connection details for OpenRouter as the initial gateway.

&#x20; 4\. Integrate this service into the `rag-service`'s background job to generate embeddings for ingested content. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 1.5: RAG Query Endpoint\*\*

&#x20; \* As a developer, I want to implement the query endpoint in the RAG service, so that users can retrieve information using graph-vector search.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Create the `query` module, controller, and service in `rag-service`. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Implement the `POST /api/v1/query` endpoint. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. The service must take a user query, generate an embedding using the `universal-ai` service, and perform a combined graph and vector search using the RedisGraphVector module. \[x] Implemented embedding + pgvector-native vector search (RedisGraph replaced by Postgres pgvector).

&#x20; 4\. Retrieve relevant documents from PostgreSQL and return them. \[x]

***

\### \*\*Epic 2: Deep Research Engine & Web UI\*\*

\*\*Objective:\*\* Build the backend service for scraping and aggregating web content, and the frontend web UI for users to manage and view research.

\* \*\*Story 2.1: Research Backend Scaffolding\*\*

&#x20; \* As a developer, I want a Python FastAPI backend for the deep research service, so I can efficiently handle web scraping tasks.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Create a new FastAPI application in `packages/research-backend`. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Implement the `POST /api/v1/research` and `GET /api/v1/research/{job\_id}` endpoints. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Integrate Celery with the Redis instance for handling long-running scraping jobs. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 2.2: Web Scraping Logic\*\*

&#x20; \* As a researcher, I want the backend to scrape content from a given URL, so that I can gather data.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Implement a Celery worker that uses Playwright to fetch and parse web content. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. The worker should extract the main text content, clean it, and prepare it for ingestion. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. The worker will call the `rag-service`'s `/api/v1/ingest` endpoint to feed the scraped content into the RAG. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 2.3: Web UI Scaffolding\*\*

&#x20; \* As a researcher, I want a React-based web UI to interact with the research service.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Create a new React/Vite/TS application in `apps/web-ui`. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Configure Tailwind CSS v4.1.5 for styling. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Create the main application layout with a header, sidebar, and content area. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 2.4: Web UI Research Interaction\*\*

&#x20; \* As a researcher, I want to submit a research query and view the results in the web UI.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Build a form component to submit a research query to the `research-backend`. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Create a "Job Status" component that polls the `GET /api/v1/research/{job\_id}` endpoint. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Create a results display component to render the aggregated research findings. \[x]

\### \*\*Epic 3: Chat Sync Chrome Extension\*\*

\*\*Objective:\*\* Develop the browser extension for syncing conversations from Google Gemini and chat.z.ai.

\* \*\*Story 3.1: Extension Scaffolding\*\*

&#x20; \* As a developer, I want to scaffold the Chrome extension with the necessary manifest and build configurations.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Create a new React/Vite/TS application in `apps/chrome-extension`.

&#x20; 2\. Create the `manifest.json` file, defining permissions, content scripts, and background logic. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Configure the build process to output a valid extension package (esbuild). \[x]

\* \*\*Story 3.2: Content Script Implementation\*\*

&#x20; \* As a user, I want the extension to detect and extract my conversations when I'm on Gemini or chat.z.ai.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Write a content script that safely injects into the chat platforms' pages. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Implement DOM observers to detect new messages in the chat UI. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Extract message content and send it to the background sync logic. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 3.3: Real-time Sync Logic\*\*

&#x20; \* As a developer, I want the extension to sync new messages to my RAG service in real-time.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Implement the background logic using MV3 service worker and alarms. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. The background service worker will receive messages from the content script. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. It will then call the `rag-service`'s `/api/v1/ingest` endpoint to sync the message. \[x]

\* \*\*Story 3.4: Bulk Export UI & Logic\*\*

&#x20; \* As a user, I want a simple UI to trigger a bulk export of my entire chat history.

&#x20; \* \*\*Tasks:\*\*

&#x20; 1\. Create a simple popup UI for the extension icon. \[x]

&#x20; 2\. Add a "Bulk Export" button to the popup. \[x]

&#x20; 3\. Implement the logic to programmatically scroll through the chat history, extract all messages, and send them to the RAG service. \[x]

\*... Epics 4, 5, and 6 would be broken down with similar granularity, covering the GitHub Sync Service, the Warp CLI implementation, Motion integration, authentication, and final testing.\*
